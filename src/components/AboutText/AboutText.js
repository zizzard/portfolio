        Hello! I am Zach Izzard, a programmer and designer whose passion for new
        challenges and eye for good design has led me through life. My extensive
        education experience has prepared me to tackle any problem that I face,
        eager to learn the newest technology and tackle the latest issue at
        hand. In my free time, I try to combine these passions with my love for
        music through the creation of album art and data visualization programs.
        I'd like to welcome you to my new home :)
